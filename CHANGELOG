   (Specify None or '' as the argument to file name.)                    [FEATURE]
 - Changed hash to use a "superfast" hash rather than md5 since md5 is

0.2.0 2011-11-13)
 - Fixed hashing to use md5 hash and change the bit computation to pass
   accuracy test.                                                        [BUG]

 - Added __dealloc__ to fix memory/resource leaks.                       [BUG]
 - Added .close() method to forcibly close a bloom filter object.        [FEATURE]

0.1.20 2010-12-21)
 - Changed prime number finder to use a standard double and add 1 to find
   likely numbers in log(n) time.

0.1.18 2010-10-25)
 - Fixed issue #5, wherein a call to open() returning an invalid fd would
   cause a seg fault.                                                     [BUG]

0.1.12 2010-4-5)
 - Added __len__ which gives a good estimate of how many elements were
   inserted [FEATURE]
 - Removed __ixor__ since it didn't make much sense.
 - Added .intersect() and .union() as a synonym for __iand__ and __ior__ [FEATURE]
 - Added reserved space to the BloomFilter structure to support future updates. [FEATURE]

0.1.10 2010-4-2)
 - Added MANIFEST so that building distributions works [FEATURE]
 - Restructured docs so that html is a symlink to the _build/html directory [FEATURE]
 - Added Cython detection in setup.py. Building now works without Cython installed [FEATURE]

 - Fixed bug where opening invalid bloom files caused seg faults [BUG]
 - Fixed alignment bug where sometimes hash seeds would not      [BUG]
   be compared correctly.
